# Contributing Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this!
From commenting on and triaging issues, to reviewing and sending Pull Requests,
all contributions are welcome. We aim to build a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem of partners,
core contributors, and community that goes beyond the main React Native GitHub repository.

Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

## Code of Conduct

As a reminder, all contributors are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

### Contributing code

Code-level contributions in this project come in the form of [pull requests](https://github.com/Walidoux/react-ios15-icons/pulls). These are done by forking the repo and making changes locally.

The process of proposing a change to this project can be summarized as follows:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `develop`.
2. Make the desired changes or features you would like to implement. Use the packages/rn-tester app to test them out.
3. Ensure the test suite passes, either locally or on CI once you opened a pull request.
   Make sure your code lints even though a script is ran as pre-commit after every commit which lints code for you so you will avoid manually.
4. Push the changes to your fork.
5. Create a pull request to the repository.
6. Review if needed and address comments on your pull request.
7. A bot may comment with suggestions. Generally we ask you to resolve these first before a maintainer will review your code.
8. If changes are requested and addressed, please request review to notify reviewers to take another look.
9. If all goes well, your pull request will be merged. If it is not merged, maintainers will do their best to explain the reason why.

### GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs exclusively. We have documented our issue handling processes in the Triaging Issues Page.
